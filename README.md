I tried to classify an image of my favourite 5 sports people.
I created simple SVM model to get a feel of how it is going to perform on image classification.
Then I used GridSearchCV and try different models with different hyper parameters to come up with a best model that can give us maximum accuracy.
I used sklearn classification_report to check the performance
